# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. This is an initial change, I deleted the lorem ipsum stuff. I am planning on making some kind of a walking cat simulator, that keeps track of how long your cat walks and in what environment.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Do you like cats? Do you like peaceful moments with cats? Then play Walking Cat Simulator! This is a simple web browser game that allows you to walk as a cat across different environments. You can change what type and color of cat you have and can even save your preferred cat and environment. Come join and enjoy your peaceful cat walk.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to select cat and background
- Ability for user to save their preferred cat and background
- Cat images from The Cat API
- Leaderboard of top 10 time spent played by user

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages: one for login, one for the game, and one for the leaderboard. Hyperlinks to pages.
- **CSS** - Application styling and applying sprites to play page and background. Adjusting size based on screen size and follows good color choice and design.
- **React** - Provides login, cat and background changes, backend endpoint calls
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - retrieving saved user background and cat info
    - leaderboard
    - displayed a random cat picture using https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search service.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, background and cat saves, and time played in database. Register and login users. Credential securly stored in database. Cannot save or be on leaderboard unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user saves their cat and background information, their choice is broadcast to all other users.
