You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages: one for login, one for the game, and one for the leaderboard. Hyperlinks to pages.
- **CSS** - Application styling and applying sprites to play page and background. Adjusting size based on screen size and follows good color choice and design.
- **React** - Provides login, cat and background changes, backend endpoint calls
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - retrieving saved user background and cat info
    - leaderboard
    - displays a random cat picture using https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search service.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, background and cat saves, and time played in database. Register and login users. Credential securly stored in database. Cannot save or be on leaderboard unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user saves their cat and background information, their choice is broadcast to all other users.
